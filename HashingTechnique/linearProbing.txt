// linear probing is littel more time taking : but less memory consumption 
// suitable if number of keys < size of hashtable 
// h(x) = ( h(x)  + i ) : i = 0 ; if occupied i++
// search will be time consuming : 
// loading function  lambda = n/size 
// leading factor shuld be <.5 ;
// so again too wastage of space 
// deletion should be problematic 
// we have to shift ; which is not easy in this case 
// deletion's solution is deleting taking out all the key , and delete that one and reinsertion 
// we can give a flag that key is there but deleted , 
// generally deletion is not prefferd with linear probing
