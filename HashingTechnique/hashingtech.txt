// hash function is h(x) = x%10;
// hash array is a pointer array to nodes at the point staisfy and chaining will occure in inserted order 
// n = number of keys 
// size = 10 : means size of hashtable 
// then loading factore is defined as lambda = n/size;
// average sucessful search time = 1 + (lambda/2);
// average unsucessfull search time = 1 + lambda ;
// hash function need not to be x%10 ;
// it can be (x/10)%10;
// loading factors means keys are already distrubted : 
// responsibility of worst case is hashfucntion : so we have to choose proper hashfucntion so that keys will get uniformaly distribute and 
// atleast to major extent keys are uniformaly distribute: 

// for implementing chainig we require linked list :
