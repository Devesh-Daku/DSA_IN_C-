// in one hash array we will have double hash function ; when one fails we will use another one 
// second hash fucntion is desired is haveing some prime thing : suld try to cover all the indices except 0;
// example  H(x) = x%10;
// example  H(x) = 7 - (x%7)

// another ides use single hashfucntion sum of the both hashfucntions 
// property of hash function : 
// always have an idea of data we going to insert 
// if using linear probing size of hash table must be more than double 
// SIZE to be try to be prime number 

// mid square meathod 
// means middle of square :: example 11 = > 121 => 2 = index
