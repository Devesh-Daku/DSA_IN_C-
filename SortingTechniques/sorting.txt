various ways of sorting 
1. Bubble
2. Selection
3. Insertion
//---
4. heap
5. merge
6. Quick
7. tree
8. Shell
// index based 
9. Count
10. Bucket/bin 
11. Radix Sort 


How to compare between them 
1. Number of comparison made in a sorting meathod
2. Number of Swaps happend in a sorting meathod
3. Adoptive // if the sorting techniques taking minimum time on a already or nearby sorted list 
4. Stable // if the algorithm preserving the order of duplicate element then it is called stable 
5. Extra Memory 

form 1. to 8 sorting algorithm : called comparison based sort : 
from 9 to 11 called index sort : 
from 1 to 3 algorithm takes N-square order of time : 
from 4 to 7 takes  nlog(n) order of ime : 
the index sort from 9 to 11 takes order of n time : 
the 8th Shell sort takes  order of N power ( 3/2 ) time : 

// Let's compare Bubble sort and Insertion Sort 

min comp ::  n      n 
max comp ::  n^2    n^2
min swap ::  1       1
max swap ::  n^2    n^2
adaptive :: yes     yes 
stable   :: no      no
LL suitable: No     yes
k passes :: yes     No  

only two algo are adaptive and only three are stable out of thee the two are bubble and Insertion
