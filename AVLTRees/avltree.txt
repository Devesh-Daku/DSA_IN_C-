bf = height of left sub tree - height of right sub tree 
balance factor ( bf ) = { -1, 0 , 1} // called balacnde 
if |bf| > 1 imbalanced node 
if |bf| <= balanced node 

// Rotation 
        30          20
       /           /  \
      20    >>   10    30 
     /
    10 
called LL imbalanced so rotation can be called as 
LL rotation ,cw rotation ,right rotation...
rotation is always done with three node only
so rr rotation will be on rr imbalance 
    10                20      
      \              /  \ 
       20     >>   10    30 
         \ 
          30 

// LR imbalance 
        30                   30
       /                    /  
      10   >>R rotation    20      >>  L rotation  balanced tree
       \                  /
        20               10 
     

similarly RL rotation :
